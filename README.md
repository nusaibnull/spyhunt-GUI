# SpyHunt GUI Launcher

This repository contains the original `spyhunt` tool by [gotr00t0day](https://github.com/gotr00t0day/spyhunt), along with a custom Python GUI launcher.

The GUI (`spyhunt_GUI_v2.exe`) requires the main `spyhunt.py` script to run, but it works best if you first remove the ASCII banner from the script.

## How to Install and Run

Follow these steps exactly to set up the GUI and the script.

1.  **Clone the Original Repository:**
    First, you need to get the main `spyhunt` tool.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/gotr00t0day/spyhunt](https://github.com/gotr00t0day/spyhunt)
    ```
    This will create a folder named `spyhunt` containing `spyhunt.py` and other files.

2.  **Remove the Banner from the Script:**
    * Run the `spyhunt_banner_remover.exe` script.
    * It will ask you to select the file. Click the browse button.
    * Navigate into the `spyhunt` folder you just cloned and select the `spyhunt.py` file.
    * The banner remover will process this file and save a modified version (this new version will be used by the GUI).

3.  **Launch the GUI:**
    * Now, run the `spyhunt_GUI_v2.exe` script to open the graphical interface.

4.  **Set the Correct Script Path:**
    * Inside the GUI, at the top, you will see a "SpyHunt Path" field with a "Browse..." button. Click it.
    * **Important:** Select the `spyhunt.py` file that was generated by the `spyhunt_banner_remover.exe` (the modified one), *not* the original one from the cloned folder.

5.  **Start Scanning:**
    * You are all set. Add your target URL, select your scan options from the tabs, and click "Start SpyHunt Scan".
